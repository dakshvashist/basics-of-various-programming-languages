JavaScript

Single threaded execution
Synchronous events - One after the other
Event loop/event queue
Call stack - First come first serve basis

Take the example of a stuck browser tab and you click various buttons on the website. You get no response at first, but when the tab starts working properly again all the items in the Call Stack are executed one after the other
